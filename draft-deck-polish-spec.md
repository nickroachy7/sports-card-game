# Draft Deck — Polish & Feel Spec (v1.1)

**Status:** Draft · **Owner:** user
**Companion specs:** `draft-deck-ui-ux-spec.md` (§4 card anatomy, §6 big
moments, §7 motion system).

This document is the home for post–Phase 5 polish work — pieces of the
product that are *functional today* but feel flat, unpolished, or
under-legible. Entries here are executed after the launch-critical
cron + rank wiring (Phase 5), and either get their own phase milestone
or ride along with other polish work in a named "feel pass."

Each entry has:
- **Goal** — what the user should feel after
- **Behavior** — concrete interaction rules
- **Acceptance** — testable criteria
- **Dependencies** — code that needs to exist or change
- **Trade-offs** — what we're trading away

---

## 1. Physical card motion (every card-movement moment)

### Goal

Cards should feel like physical objects — lifted, dragged, and
dropped with weight. The player's mental model is "I'm moving a
collectible, not clicking a cell in a spreadsheet." Today every card
movement is instant or uses a generic CSS transition; everywhere a
card moves, that should feel like an object in motion.

### Scope — applies to every drag-drop card-movement surface in v1.1

1. **Lineup building**
   - Bench → slot drop
   - Slot → slot reorder (swap)
   - Slot → bench (remove from lineup)
2. **Vault selection** — drag-to-vault-dropzone (replaces today's
   tap-to-toggle).
3. **Quick-sell dissolve** and **season-end dissolve** — currently
   opacity fade; upgrade to a coherent motion vocabulary.
4. **Tier-up cut-in** (§6.3, already deferred) — when it lands, it
   uses this vocabulary.

**Out of v1.1 scope** (gets its own polish slice later):
- **Pack opening reveal.** The carousel + flip needs its own redesign
  pass — current version is lackluster and deserves more than a motion
  refresh. Parked; revisit as a standalone "pack reveal polish" slice.

Everything below applies uniformly to every in-scope surface unless
the "where" column notes otherwise.

### Behavior

| Phase | What happens | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Idle | Card sits with a resting elevation (`shadow-sm`). | All |
| Hover | 2px lift + shadow grows (matches UI/UX §4.12 rest state). | Lineup, collection, bench, vault selection |
| Pick-up (`mousedown` / pointer grab) | Card scales 1.03, shadow deepens sharply. Max 3° tilt during fast drags, invisible at rest — subtle. Spring-based (not linear). | Any draggable card |
| Dragging | Card follows the cursor with a spring-delay (~80ms lag). Origin slot goes empty (outlined empty slot — no ghost silhouette, no label swap). Ghost image is **the card**, not the default browser drag preview. | Any draggable card |
| Hover-over-valid-target | Target slot highlights (team accent border pulse). Card shadow lightens to signal "about to commit." | Lineup slots, vault drop zone |
| Hover-over-invalid-target | Target stays inert. Card cursor shows dashed-forbidden border. | Lineup slots where position doesn't match |
| Drop on valid | Card snaps into slot with ease-out over ~180ms. Slot briefly flashes team accent, then settles. | All |
| Drop on invalid | Card bounces back to origin with a shake (small lateral oscillation, ~350ms). | All |
| Release in empty space | Same as invalid — return to origin with shake. | All |

### Spring personality — iOS-snappy

Locked: **quick pick-up, tight follow, firm snap.** Think "paper card,
responsive" — not "thick cardstock with foil bounce." The feel is
slick and immediate; you feel the card respond as fast as you're
moving it.

Motion config (starting point, tunable during P6.2):
- `stiffness: 400`
- `damping: 30`
- `mass: 1`

Any spring that feels sluggish gets tuned toward stiffer / higher
damping during the P6.2 smoke pass.

### Tilt on pick-up — subtle

Max 3° during fast drags, imperceptible at rest. No casino-dealer
theatrics — the tilt is a speed cue, not a flourish.

### Origin slot during drag — empty

When a card leaves its slot mid-drag, the slot shows the outlined
empty state (same as a never-filled slot). No ghost silhouette, no
position-label text swap. Clean.

### Invalid-drop treatment (confirmed)

Card bounces back to origin with a short horizontal shake. No toast.
The forbidden cursor during the drag is enough signal — post-drop
should land in place, not nag. Shake is visual feedback that the
attempt was seen and rejected.

### Acceptance

- [ ] Dragging a bench card onto a legal lineup slot spring-lands
  with a perceivable settle, not an instant snap.
- [ ] Dragging a SS card onto the 1B slot bounces back with a shake
  and no error toast.
- [ ] Dragging a card from slot → bench removes it with the same
  physics language.
- [ ] Vault ceremony selection uses drag-into-vault-dropzone; tap
  still toggles as a fallback (accessibility).
- [ ] Pack opening reveal uses the same spring language on arrival
  (not the current flip-in).
- [ ] Reduced-motion honored: all springs degrade to instant
  snaps + opacity swap. No shake. No tilt. Per UI/UX §7.3.
- [ ] 60fps sustained on a 2020-era MBP during a full lineup build
  (10 drag-drops back-to-back).

### Dependencies

- `motion` (framer-motion) — already locked in stack §1.1. Use its
  `useDragControls` + `animate()` primitives.
- `react-dnd` — already in use for bench→slot; combine with motion
  by treating react-dnd for validity/target logic and motion for the
  render-side spring. Alternative: migrate fully to motion's drag
  API and drop react-dnd. **Decision:** keep react-dnd for the hit-
  testing layer (already spec-approved in UI/UX §11 "Keep"); motion
  handles visuals only.
- New shared hook: `useCardDrag(cardId)` that wraps both libs and
  exposes `{ dragState, onPointerDown, onPointerMove, onDrop }`.
- The existing `CustomDragLayer` pattern (§11) stays — we replace
  its default ghost with the real `<Card>` element at animated
  scale + tilt.

### Trade-offs

- **Motion cost:** springs at 60fps on every slot + the card face is
  more GPU work than today's opacity-only transitions. Need to verify
  on low-end hardware during P6 smoke.
- **Keyboard accessibility:** drag-drop-only interactions break for
  keyboard users. We mitigate via the tap-fallback for vault
  selection and by keeping keyboard-first flows (arrow-key slot
  traversal + enter-to-pick) working in the lineup.
- **Scope creep risk:** "coherent motion language across every
  movement" is easy to keep expanding. v1.1 ships the six movement
  paths listed in Scope — any new movement (e.g., a future trade
  screen) gets the vocabulary for free but isn't part of this slice.

---

## 2. Full-anatomy Small card (match Collection, just smaller)

### Goal

Today's Small card (96×134) is intentionally stripped — the
component (`src/components/card/Card.tsx`) hides position, team,
stats footer, and name at this size. Only the photo + status pill
survive. With photo sync still stubbed, the user sees two initials
and nothing else, which is why managing a lineup feels like reading
cell IDs.

**Fix: Small renders the same anatomy as Medium / Collection, just
scaled.** No new widgets invented. No separate design language. The
card you drag into the Collection page is the card you see on the
diamond, only smaller.

### What changes in the `<Card>` component

Drop the `!isSmall` guards on the position tag, team chip, stats
footer, name, FP, contract count, and `+ Token` badge. Tune the
Small-size values in the `SIZE_STYLES` table and the font-size
ternaries so everything fits readably at 96×134.

### Layout (all of Medium, re-tuned for 96×134)

```
┌──────────────────────┐ ← tier border (§4.5 palette)
│ C           NYY      │ ← position chip + team chip (already in
│                      │   component at Medium; unhide at Small)
│     [photo or        │
│      initials]       │ ← photo area ~60% of height (matches
│                      │   Medium proportions, not current 75%)
│                      │
├──────────────────────┤
│ JOSE CABALLERO       │ ← name, uppercase tracked, trimmed at width
│ 1,247 FP      12/15  │ ← FP + contract count (existing Medium
│ + TOKEN              │   footer rows, tighter padding)
└──────────────────────┘
```

### What gets sacrificed at 96×134

Candidates to drop if the face reads as noise during P6.1 smoke:

1. `+ TOKEN` badge → swap to a small icon in the footer corner
   (fewer pixels, same signal).
2. Long names → truncate at ~12 chars with ellipsis.
3. Team chip text size → already 9px at Medium; may need 8px at
   Small. Keep monospace so digits don't shift the box width.

These are P6.1 tuning decisions, not locked-in-spec calls. If the
full-Medium layout fits at 96×134 cleanly, nothing gets sacrificed.

### Acceptance

- [ ] Small card renders: tier border, position chip, team chip,
  photo (or initials fallback), status pill, name, FP, contract
  count, token badge — all elements Medium has.
- [ ] A full legal lineup is readable from 18 inches away on a
  laptop screen without squinting.
- [ ] Same `<Card>` component drives diamond, bench drawer, vault
  selection, and Collection — no forked "small-on-lineup" code path.
- [ ] Photo sync (when live) drops into the existing photo slot
  without layout shift.
- [ ] Medium + Large cards untouched — no regression on Collection
  or Card Detail.

### Bench drawer + vault selection

Same component, same size. The bench drawer stays a horizontal
scroller. Vault selection grid switches from its bespoke thumb to
the shared Small card.

### Dependencies

- `src/components/card/Card.tsx` — remove `!isSmall` guards on
  position tag (line 123), team chip (line 136), stats footer (line
  166). Tune `SIZE_STYLES` padding + font-size ternaries for Small.
- `src/components/lineup/BenchCard.tsx`,
  `src/components/lineup/LineupSlot.tsx` — already consume `<Card
  size="small">`, no call-site changes.
- `src/components/vault/VaultCeremony.tsx` `CardThumb` — replace
  with `<Card size="small">`.
- **No schema changes.** `CardViewModel` already has every field
  the component needs.

### Trade-offs

- **Readability at 96×134.** Medium font sizes were tuned for 160×224;
  at 75% of that canvas some text may be too small. P6.1 smoke
  validates; tune down if needed.
- **No hover-expand.** A user who wants truly deep stats still
  clicks into Card Detail. Medium-card info never leaks onto the
  diamond separately — it *is* the diamond.

---

## 3. Shared implementation notes

### Motion language cross-reference

Both features touch `<Card>`. Order of work:
1. **Rich Small card first** (doesn't depend on motion rework).
2. **Physical motion second** — we want to animate the new richer
   card, not rebuild the animation then the face.

### Performance budget

- 60fps during a full lineup build on mid-tier hardware.
- First meaningful paint on the Lineup page ≤ current baseline.
- Bundle size increase ≤ 8KB gzipped (we're re-using existing deps).

### Testing

- Visual: Chromatic snapshot per card state (idle / hover / dragging
  / invalid-drop / dropped).
- E2E: Playwright scenario that drags a card onto a slot and
  verifies the assignment persisted + the motion completed (use
  `waitForAnimations()`).
- Reduced-motion: unit test that the spring config swaps to instant
  when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is set.

---

## 4. Not in scope for v1.1

Flagged so they don't sneak in during the polish pass:

- Tier-frame foil motion (silver shine, gold bloom, diamond
  shimmer). UI/UX §4.5 deferred these; they're a separate polish
  slice.
- Haptic feedback (no mobile web at launch per §1).
- Sound design — still deferred.
- Pack-opening full redesign — only its arrival physics gets the
  new language; the carousel + reveal sequence stays.
- Card face illustrations / artwork — separate art pass.

---

# Phase 7 batch — polish items locked 2026-04-21

The five entries below were locked via interview after Phase 6 shipped.
Same authoring pattern as §1–§2. These define the Phase 7 (v1.2) feel
pass.

---

## 5. Applied tokens — circular drag-drop with corner overlay

### Goal

Tokens today are a static list in a tray — users don't know which
player a conditional modifier was *meant for* until contest time.
Promote tokens into the same physical vocabulary as cards: circular
pips that you pick up and drop onto a player. Once applied, the token
rides on the card's corner so the user sees their commitments at a
glance.

### Behavior

- **Tray:** each token renders as a circular pip (~44px at rest).
  Multiple of the same token type surface as separate pips, not a
  stack (single-token cap per card means stacking isn't useful).
- **Hover tooltip:** hovering a tray pip OR an applied pip shows a
  small popup with the conditional rule verbatim ("If this player
  hits a HR, +5 FP"). Dismisses on mouse-leave. Same tooltip
  component in both places.
- **Apply (drag):** pick up a tray pip; while dragged, hovered cards
  light up using the §1 valid-target treatment. Drop on a card →
  pip springs into the card's bottom-right corner, overlaid so ~50%
  of the pip sits outside the tier frame (breaks the border). Tray
  pip is **consumed** (disappears).
- **One token per card.** Dropping on an already-tokened card
  shake-bounces back to the tray (§1 invalid vocabulary).
- **Remove (click):** click the applied pip → inline "Remove?"
  confirm → second click destroys the token. **Removal does not
  return the token to the tray** — consistent with the "consumed on
  apply" rule. Mistakes are recoverable by re-earning the token.
  *(Proposed; confirm on review. Softer alternative: remove returns
  to tray. Destroy is simpler and aligns with the vault destroy-on-
  remove pattern.)*

### Motion

Reuses the §1 vocabulary:
- Pick-up: 1.08 scale + spring lift.
- Drag: cursor-follow with ~80ms lag.
- Valid drop: pip snaps to corner, ~180ms ease-out, tiny settle.
- Invalid drop (already tokened, or released in empty space):
  shake-back to origin.
- Reduced-motion: instant apply + remove, no tilt, no shake.

### Acceptance

- [ ] Token tray renders circular pips with working hover tooltips.
- [ ] Dragging a pip onto an un-tokened card applies it; tray pip is
  consumed.
- [ ] Dragging onto an already-tokened card shakes back.
- [ ] Applied pip sits at bottom-right, overlaid outside the tier
  frame; does not clip the stats footer at Small or Medium.
- [ ] Hover on applied pip shows the same conditional tooltip.
- [ ] Click applied pip → confirm → token destroyed; card returns
  to un-tokened state.
- [ ] `/palette` gains an "Applied tokens" section (Small + Medium
  card states, tooltip open state).
- [ ] Reduced-motion: instant apply, instant remove, no tilt.

### Dependencies

- New `<TokenBadge>` component at `src/components/token/TokenBadge.tsx`
  — absolute-positioned corner overlay, same anchoring pattern as
  the existing status pill.
- Tray rework in `src/components/token/TokenTray.tsx` (or equivalent):
  circular pip, hover tooltip, `useCardDrag`-compatible pick-up.
- SQL fns: `apply_token(token_id, card_id)` exists per API spec;
  add `remove_applied_token(token_application_id)` that destroys the
  application record (the token row is already consumed). Confirm
  naming against API spec §.
- Reuses `CardDragLayer` motion plumbing from Phase 6 (generic per
  ADR-0011).
- Tooltip: shadcn `Tooltip` primitive — already in stack.

### Trade-offs

- **1-token cap** trades strategic depth for legibility. If future
  phases want stacking, the corner slot grows into a row; backwards-
  compatible.
- **Destroy-on-remove vs restore-to-tray.** Destroy is simpler and
  punishes mistakes in a way that's consistent with the vault
  destroy rule. If retention telemetry shows frequent accidental
  applies, revisit.
- **No drag-off-card path.** Click-confirm is the only removal
  gesture. Symmetric drag-out would be nice but adds UX cost for
  marginal gain.

---

## 6. Lineup card single-click → shared detail drawer

### Goal

Clicking a card in a lineup slot does nothing today; drag is the only
interaction. To see a slotted card's stats or act on it, users remove
it, switch to Collection, find it, click. Add single-click-to-open on
lineup cards, reusing the Collection detail drawer with a thin
lineup-context action row appended.

### Behavior

- Single click on any card in a lineup slot OR in the bench drawer
  opens the shared `<CardDetailDrawer>` (same component Collection
  uses).
- **Drag preservation:** 5px mousedown-threshold — pointer movement
  past 5px cancels the click and starts a drag (react-dnd / motion
  standard).
- **Lineup action row** (appended below the existing drawer content
  when opened from lineup or bench):
  - Quick-sell (same path as Collection).
  - Extend contract (same path as Collection).
  - Remove from slot — sends card to bench, closes drawer, plays
    the §1 slot → bench motion. (Bench-origin cards hide this
    action.)
  - Add to vault — opens the §7 mid-season vault confirm.
- Closing the drawer returns focus to the card's origin location.

### Acceptance

- [ ] Single click on a slotted card opens the detail drawer.
- [ ] A drag starting on the same card (>5px of pointer movement)
  does not fire the click open.
- [ ] All four lineup actions are callable; each delegates to its
  existing SQL fn (§7 for vault).
- [ ] Drawer fits within the §8 no-scroll viewport budget.
- [ ] Keyboard: tab-focus + Enter opens; Escape closes.
- [ ] Reduced-motion: drawer opens without slide.

### Dependencies

- Extend `<CardDetailDrawer>` with an optional
  `lineupContext?: { slotId; onRemove; onAddToVault }` prop. When
  absent, drawer renders as on Collection.
- `remove_from_lineup_slot(slot_id)` SQL fn — confirm existing
  `update_lineup_slot` can take `card_id = NULL`; if not, add the
  paired fn.
- Mid-season vault action (§7).
- Drag-threshold helper — add to `useCardDrag` if not already there.

### Trade-offs

- **Click-vs-drag conflict** is a known pattern risk; 5px is a
  tested default. Widen to 8px on trackpads if edge cases surface.
- **Drawer height budget.** Extra action row costs vertical space;
  must still clear the §8 800px floor.

---

## 7. Mid-season vault

### Goal

The vault is only a season-end moment today — powerful, but it means
users can't mark a card as "this one's a keepsake" while the season
is live. Let users pre-vault cards any time. Once vaulted the card is
**frozen** (can't play) and can't return to Collection. Users can
destroy a pre-vaulted card for a **small** coin refund — a deliberate
exit, not a take-back. The end-of-season ceremony becomes a
confirm / last-chance moment rather than the first-and-only pick.

### Behavior

- **Entry points:**
  - Collection detail drawer → "Add to Vault".
  - Lineup detail drawer (§6) → "Add to Vault".
- **On vault:**
  - Card is moved out of the playable set **immediately**. It cannot
    be placed in a lineup. Contract plays lock (no burn, no extend,
    no refund). Status pill reads "Vaulted"; tier frame gets a muted
    / ribbon treatment.
  - Counts toward the season's 10-card vault cap.
- **Cap guard:** at 10 pre-vaulted, "Add to Vault" is disabled with
  inline reason ("Vault full — destroy a vaulted card to free a
  slot").
- **Locked-lineup guard:** if the card is currently locked into a
  submitted-but-not-yet-scored lineup, vaulting is blocked. Modal:
  "This card is in a locked lineup. Vault it after today's contest
  scores." (Answered: option A — block until scoring completes.)
- **Remove (destroy):**
  - From the Vault page, click a pre-vaulted card → confirm
    ("Destroy this card for N coins? This can't be undone.").
  - Confirm destroys the card permanently, credits tier-scaled
    coins, frees a cap slot.
  - **Refund formula:** ~15% of the card's quick-sell value at its
    tier (bronze / silver / gold / diamond), much less than quick-
    sell. Exact coin values computed in the SQL fn from economy
    config; finalize numeric in the roadmap task.
- **End-of-season ceremony:**
  - Review screen shows the pre-vaulted set + remaining collection.
  - User can **last-chance destroy** pre-vaulted cards (same
    dialog, same refund) to free cap slots.
  - If fewer than 10 pre-vaulted, user picks from collection to
    reach 10 (existing ceremony flow).
  - Final confirm = hard lock. After lock: no destroy, no add, no
    swap.

### Acceptance

- [ ] User can vault from Collection detail drawer.
- [ ] User can vault from lineup detail drawer.
- [ ] Vaulted card cannot be dragged into a slot, cannot be quick-
  sold, cannot be extended.
- [ ] Vault page lists pre-vaulted cards with the muted / ribbon
  treatment and a destroy action.
- [ ] Destroy refunds tier-scaled coins (15% of quick-sell rate),
  removes the card permanently, frees the cap slot.
- [ ] Cap of 10 is enforced on add; blocked state shows reason.
- [ ] Submitted-lineup guard prevents vaulting until the contest
  scores.
- [ ] Ceremony reuses existing pre-vaulted records; user can destroy
  during ceremony, cannot exceed 10.
- [ ] All state changes go through SQL fns (per CLAUDE.md §7).
- [ ] Append-only audit row on every destroy.

### Dependencies

- **SQL fns:**
  - `vault_card_midseason(card_id)` — validates cap, not-frozen,
    not-in-locked-lineup; inserts into vault; marks the card.
  - `destroy_vaulted_card(card_id)` — destroys the card, credits
    coins via `spend_coins`-mirror, appends to audit.
  - `commit_vault_selection(card_ids)` — existing; tighten to
    ceremony-only (idempotent if cap is already full).
- **Server Actions** in `app/actions/vault.ts`:
  `vaultCardMidseason`, `destroyVaultedCard`.
- **Schema:**
  - `card.vaulted_at timestamptz null` + `card.vault_source
    enum('midseason','ceremony') null`. RLS keeps the card visible
    to its owner but blocks playability via the existing playable-
    predicate path.
  - `vault_card_destroy` append-only audit table:
    `(id, user_id, card_id, tier, refund_coins, created_at)`.
- **UI:**
  - Vaulted card face treatment: muted tier frame + corner ribbon /
    stamp ("VAULTED").
  - "Add to Vault" action in both detail drawers.
  - Vault page updated to surface pre-vaulted cards alongside the
    ceremony CTA (in-season) and the ceremony review (season-end).

### Trade-offs

- **Freeze-on-vault vs play-until-contract-ends.** Freeze is the
  simplest rule and matches "cosmetic keepsake" framing. Play-
  through adds lifecycle complexity (vaulted-but-playable states).
- **15% refund** is generous enough to soften a mistake but small
  enough to discourage exploiting the vault as a coin sink. If a
  pack → vault → destroy arbitrage appears, drop to 5% or add a
  cooldown.
- **Cap enforced on add** (not rolling at ceremony). Simpler for
  users; forces a destroy to free slots. Ceremony last-chance-
  destroy catches the edge where someone wants to swap in a late-
  season favorite.

## 8. Lineup shell — right sidebar + no-scroll bottom strip

### Goal

The lineup page today is a single scrolling column: header → diamond
→ bench → tokens → auto-sub controls. Even on a 1080p laptop, users
scroll to reach auto-subs. Refactor into a fixed-viewport shell:
diamond center, persistent right sidebar, stacked bottom strip. **No
page scroll at 800px viewport height.**

### Layout

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Header (contest countdown, nav)                   │
├───────────────────────────────────┬────────────────┤
│                                   │  Sidebar       │
│                                   │  ─────────     │
│         Diamond (10 slots)        │  Readiness     │
│                                   │  Projected FP  │
│                                   │  Auto-subs     │
│                                   │  Submit CTA    │
├───────────────────────────────────┴────────────────┤
│  Bench (horizontal scroll inside strip)            │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Tokens tray (horizontal scroll inside strip)      │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Behavior

- **Sidebar:** persistent right column, ~288px (Tailwind `w-72`),
  visual treatment mirrors the Collection sidebar
  (`src/app/(app)/collection/collection-grid.tsx` lines 162–254):
  same uppercase-tracked section headers, mono numeric values,
  section gap. Contents top-to-bottom:
  - **Readiness:** `10 / 10 slots filled`; per-slot warnings
    (missing position, low contract, token conflicts).
  - **Projected FP:** sum across slotted players, live-updating as
    cards change.
  - **Auto-subs:** the toggles relocated from their current below-
    bench position.
  - **Submit CTA:** "Submit Lineup" button anchored at the sidebar
    bottom with the contest-deadline countdown directly above.
- **Diamond** fills the remaining main-row width (left of sidebar).
- **Bottom strip — two stacked rows:**
  - **Bench row:** Small cards, ~160px tall, horizontal scroll
    inside the row when cards overflow.
  - **Tokens tray row:** ~72px tall, circular pips (§5), horizontal
    scroll same-pattern.
  - Rows have a subtle divider; neither collapses.
- **Budget at 800px viewport:**
  - Header ~64px
  - Main (diamond + sidebar) flex-1, ~504px
  - Bench row ~160px
  - Tokens row ~72px
  - Total ~800px.
- Below 800px viewport height, page falls back to page scroll (soft
  degradation, no hard layout break).

### Acceptance

- [ ] On 1280×800 viewport, lineup page fits with no page scroll.
- [ ] Bench + tokens rows anchored to viewport bottom at any height
  ≥ 800px.
- [ ] Sidebar visible on every lineup state (empty / partial / full
  / submitted).
- [ ] Auto-sub toggles reproduce current behavior from the sidebar.
- [ ] Submit CTA lives in the sidebar; no duplicate button elsewhere.
- [ ] Projected FP updates within 100ms of any slot change.
- [ ] Below 800px viewport, page degrades to scroll without layout
  break (spot-checked at 1280×700 and 1280×600).

### Dependencies

- New shell component: `src/components/lineup/LineupShell.tsx`.
- Lineup route refactor: `src/app/(app)/lineup/page.tsx` delegates
  layout to the new shell.
- Extract Collection sidebar treatment into
  `src/components/layout/SidebarCard.tsx` (shared primitive: section
  header, mono value, divider) consumed by both pages.
- Readiness state derived from the existing lineup slot state
  machine.
- Projected FP: existing `projectFantasyPoints` helper if present;
  otherwise simple sum over `card.projected_fp` (confirm field name
  during roadmap task).
- Auto-sub component — relocate, do not rewrite.

### Trade-offs

- **Desktop-only.** ≥800px rule is fine because v1 is desktop-only
  per `draft-deck-ui-ux-spec.md` §1.
- **Fixed sidebar width** eats horizontal space on narrow laptops
  (13" @ 1280). 288px sidebar leaves ~992px for diamond — still
  comfortable.
- **No sidebar collapse.** Keeps the UI predictable; adds density
  cost. Collapse is a later polish if needed.
- **Tokens row always present.** Empty-state ("No tokens yet —
  earn some from packs") rather than collapsing the row; keeps
  layout stable.

## 9. Not in scope for v1.2

Carries forward §4 entries that remain parked, plus new deferrals:

- **Slot ↔ slot reorder and slot ↔ bench drag** — needs
  `swap_lineup_slots` SQL fn (ADR-0011 open item #2). §6's "Remove
  from slot" button covers slot → bench by click for now.
- **Pack opening reveal redesign** — still parked as its own mini-
  spec.
- **Tier foil motion** (silver shine, gold bloom, diamond shimmer).
- **Onboarding flow pass.**
- **Live contest view polish.**
- **Empty + error state sweep.**
- **Accessibility audit pass** (WCAG 2.1 AA).
- **Mobile layout.**
- **Sound design / haptics / artwork.**
