# Draft Deck — Polish & Feel Spec (v1.1)

**Status:** Draft · **Owner:** user
**Companion specs:** `draft-deck-ui-ux-spec.md` (§4 card anatomy, §6 big
moments, §7 motion system).

This document is the home for post–Phase 5 polish work — pieces of the
product that are *functional today* but feel flat, unpolished, or
under-legible. Entries here are executed after the launch-critical
cron + rank wiring (Phase 5), and either get their own phase milestone
or ride along with other polish work in a named "feel pass."

Each entry has:
- **Goal** — what the user should feel after
- **Behavior** — concrete interaction rules
- **Acceptance** — testable criteria
- **Dependencies** — code that needs to exist or change
- **Trade-offs** — what we're trading away

## 1. Physical card motion (every card-movement moment)

### Goal

Cards should feel like physical objects — lifted, dragged, and
dropped with weight. The player's mental model is "I'm moving a
collectible, not clicking a cell in a spreadsheet." Today every card
movement is instant or uses a generic CSS transition; everywhere a
card moves, that should feel like an object in motion.

### Scope — applies to every drag-drop card-movement surface in v1.1

1. **Lineup building**
   - Bench → slot drop
   - Slot → slot reorder (swap)
   - Slot → bench (remove from lineup)
2. **Vault selection** — drag-to-vault-dropzone (replaces today's
   tap-to-toggle).
3. **Quick-sell dissolve** and **season-end dissolve** — currently
   opacity fade; upgrade to a coherent motion vocabulary.
4. **Tier-up cut-in** (§6.3, already deferred) — when it lands, it
   uses this vocabulary.

**Out of v1.1 scope** (gets its own polish slice later):
- **Pack opening reveal.** The carousel + flip needs its own redesign
  pass — current version is lackluster and deserves more than a motion
  refresh. Parked; revisit as a standalone "pack reveal polish" slice.

Everything below applies uniformly to every in-scope surface unless
the "where" column notes otherwise.

### Behavior

| Phase | What happens | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Idle | Card sits with a resting elevation (`shadow-sm`). | All |
| Hover | 2px lift + shadow grows (matches UI/UX §4.12 rest state). | Lineup, collection, bench, vault selection |
| Pick-up (`mousedown` / pointer grab) | Card scales 1.03, shadow deepens sharply. Max 3° tilt during fast drags, invisible at rest — subtle. Spring-based (not linear). | Any draggable card |
| Dragging | Card follows the cursor with a spring-delay (~80ms lag). Origin slot goes empty (outlined empty slot — no ghost silhouette, no label swap). Ghost image is **the card**, not the default browser drag preview. | Any draggable card |
| Hover-over-valid-target | Target slot highlights (team accent border pulse). Card shadow lightens to signal "about to commit." | Lineup slots, vault drop zone |
| Hover-over-invalid-target | Target stays inert. Card cursor shows dashed-forbidden border. | Lineup slots where position doesn't match |
| Drop on valid | Card snaps into slot with ease-out over ~180ms. Slot briefly flashes team accent, then settles. | All |
| Drop on invalid | Card bounces back to origin with a shake (small lateral oscillation, ~350ms). | All |
| Release in empty space | Same as invalid — return to origin with shake. | All |

### Spring personality — iOS-snappy

Locked: **quick pick-up, tight follow, firm snap.** Think "paper card,
responsive" — not "thick cardstock with foil bounce." The feel is
slick and immediate; you feel the card respond as fast as you're
moving it.

Motion config (starting point, tunable during P6.2):
- `stiffness: 400`
- `damping: 30`
- `mass: 1`

Any spring that feels sluggish gets tuned toward stiffer / higher
damping during the P6.2 smoke pass.

### Tilt on pick-up — subtle

Max 3° during fast drags, imperceptible at rest. No casino-dealer
theatrics — the tilt is a speed cue, not a flourish.

### Origin slot during drag — empty

When a card leaves its slot mid-drag, the slot shows the outlined
empty state (same as a never-filled slot). No ghost silhouette, no
position-label text swap. Clean.

### Invalid-drop treatment (confirmed)

Card bounces back to origin with a short horizontal shake. No toast.
The forbidden cursor during the drag is enough signal — post-drop
should land in place, not nag. Shake is visual feedback that the
attempt was seen and rejected.

### Acceptance

- [ ] Dragging a bench card onto a legal lineup slot spring-lands
  with a perceivable settle, not an instant snap.
- [ ] Dragging a SS card onto the 1B slot bounces back with a shake
  and no error toast.
- [ ] Dragging a card from slot → bench removes it with the same
  physics language.
- [ ] Vault ceremony selection uses drag-into-vault-dropzone; tap
  still toggles as a fallback (accessibility).
- [ ] Pack opening reveal uses the same spring language on arrival
  (not the current flip-in).
- [ ] Reduced-motion honored: all springs degrade to instant
  snaps + opacity swap. No shake. No tilt. Per UI/UX §7.3.
- [ ] 60fps sustained on a 2020-era MBP during a full lineup build
  (10 drag-drops back-to-back).

### Dependencies

- `motion` (framer-motion) — already locked in stack §1.1. Use its
  `useDragControls` + `animate()` primitives.
- `react-dnd` — already in use for bench→slot; combine with motion
  by treating react-dnd for validity/target logic and motion for the
  render-side spring. Alternative: migrate fully to motion's drag
  API and drop react-dnd. **Decision:** keep react-dnd for the hit-
  testing layer (already spec-approved in UI/UX §11 "Keep"); motion
  handles visuals only.
- New shared hook: `useCardDrag(cardId)` that wraps both libs and
  exposes `{ dragState, onPointerDown, onPointerMove, onDrop }`.
- The existing `CustomDragLayer` pattern (§11) stays — we replace
  its default ghost with the real `<Card>` element at animated
  scale + tilt.

### Trade-offs

- **Motion cost:** springs at 60fps on every slot + the card face is
  more GPU work than today's opacity-only transitions. Need to verify
  on low-end hardware during P6 smoke.
- **Keyboard accessibility:** drag-drop-only interactions break for
  keyboard users. We mitigate via the tap-fallback for vault
  selection and by keeping keyboard-first flows (arrow-key slot
  traversal + enter-to-pick) working in the lineup.
- **Scope creep risk:** "coherent motion language across every
  movement" is easy to keep expanding. v1.1 ships the six movement
  paths listed in Scope — any new movement (e.g., a future trade
  screen) gets the vocabulary for free but isn't part of this slice.

## 2. Full-anatomy Small card (match Collection, just smaller)

### Goal

Today's Small card (96×134) is intentionally stripped — the
component (`src/components/card/Card.tsx`) hides position, team,
stats footer, and name at this size. Only the photo + status pill
survive. With photo sync still stubbed, the user sees two initials
and nothing else, which is why managing a lineup feels like reading
cell IDs.

**Fix: Small renders the same anatomy as Medium / Collection, just
scaled.** No new widgets invented. No separate design language. The
card you drag into the Collection page is the card you see on the
diamond, only smaller.

### What changes in the `<Card>` component

Drop the `!isSmall` guards on the position tag, team chip, stats
footer, name, FP, contract count, and `+ Token` badge. Tune the
Small-size values in the `SIZE_STYLES` table and the font-size
ternaries so everything fits readably at 96×134.

### Layout (all of Medium, re-tuned for 96×134)

```
┌──────────────────────┐ ← tier border (§4.5 palette)
│ C           NYY      │ ← position chip + team chip (already in
│                      │   component at Medium; unhide at Small)
│     [photo or        │
│      initials]       │ ← photo area ~60% of height (matches
│                      │   Medium proportions, not current 75%)
│                      │
├──────────────────────┤
│ JOSE CABALLERO       │ ← name, uppercase tracked, trimmed at width
│ 1,247 FP      12/15  │ ← FP + contract count (existing Medium
│ + TOKEN              │   footer rows, tighter padding)
└──────────────────────┘
```

### What gets sacrificed at 96×134

Candidates to drop if the face reads as noise during P6.1 smoke:

1. `+ TOKEN` badge → swap to a small icon in the footer corner
   (fewer pixels, same signal).
2. Long names → truncate at ~12 chars with ellipsis.
3. Team chip text size → already 9px at Medium; may need 8px at
   Small. Keep monospace so digits don't shift the box width.

These are P6.1 tuning decisions, not locked-in-spec calls. If the
full-Medium layout fits at 96×134 cleanly, nothing gets sacrificed.

### Acceptance

- [ ] Small card renders: tier border, position chip, team chip,
  photo (or initials fallback), status pill, name, FP, contract
  count, token badge — all elements Medium has.
- [ ] A full legal lineup is readable from 18 inches away on a
  laptop screen without squinting.
- [ ] Same `<Card>` component drives diamond, bench drawer, vault
  selection, and Collection — no forked "small-on-lineup" code path.
- [ ] Photo sync (when live) drops into the existing photo slot
  without layout shift.
- [ ] Medium + Large cards untouched — no regression on Collection
  or Card Detail.

### Bench drawer + vault selection

Same component, same size. The bench drawer stays a horizontal
scroller. Vault selection grid switches from its bespoke thumb to
the shared Small card.

### Dependencies

- `src/components/card/Card.tsx` — remove `!isSmall` guards on
  position tag (line 123), team chip (line 136), stats footer (line
  166). Tune `SIZE_STYLES` padding + font-size ternaries for Small.
- `src/components/lineup/BenchCard.tsx`,
  `src/components/lineup/LineupSlot.tsx` — already consume `<Card
  size="small">`, no call-site changes.
- `src/components/vault/VaultCeremony.tsx` `CardThumb` — replace
  with `<Card size="small">`.
- **No schema changes.** `CardViewModel` already has every field
  the component needs.

### Trade-offs

- **Readability at 96×134.** Medium font sizes were tuned for 160×224;
  at 75% of that canvas some text may be too small. P6.1 smoke
  validates; tune down if needed.
- **No hover-expand.** A user who wants truly deep stats still
  clicks into Card Detail. Medium-card info never leaks onto the
  diamond separately — it *is* the diamond.

## 3. Shared implementation notes

### Motion language cross-reference

Both features touch `<Card>`. Order of work:
1. **Rich Small card first** (doesn't depend on motion rework).
2. **Physical motion second** — we want to animate the new richer
   card, not rebuild the animation then the face.

### Performance budget

- 60fps during a full lineup build on mid-tier hardware.
- First meaningful paint on the Lineup page ≤ current baseline.
- Bundle size increase ≤ 8KB gzipped (we're re-using existing deps).

### Testing

- Visual: Chromatic snapshot per card state (idle / hover / dragging
  / invalid-drop / dropped).
- E2E: Playwright scenario that drags a card onto a slot and
  verifies the assignment persisted + the motion completed (use
  `waitForAnimations()`).
- Reduced-motion: unit test that the spring config swaps to instant
  when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is set.

## 4. Not in scope for v1.1

Flagged so they don't sneak in during the polish pass:

- Tier-frame foil motion (silver shine, gold bloom, diamond
  shimmer). UI/UX §4.5 deferred these; they're a separate polish
  slice.
- Haptic feedback (no mobile web at launch per §1).
- Sound design — still deferred.
- Pack-opening full redesign — only its arrival physics gets the
  new language; the carousel + reveal sequence stays.
- Card face illustrations / artwork — separate art pass.
